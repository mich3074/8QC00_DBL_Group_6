In the calculate-overlap branch, you can find the code that is used to compare the peaks of different kind of bed files.
The newest version is raw comparison code versie 5.
You can also find a folder with the csv files after the peaks have been compared, it is called AR_Motif_Peaks_2. AR_Motif_Peaks is an old folder, wit the wrong files. AR_Motif_Peaks_3 also does not contain the files that were eventually used in the project.
